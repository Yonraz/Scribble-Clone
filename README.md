# Scribble-Clone
  a web project built upon my paint project, designed to further improve architecture and readability, 
  also adding web sockets to allow multiple users to draw on the same canvas

# Main Technologies
  - Canvas API
  - React.js
  - Javascript
  - Socket.io

# Main Features
  - Drawing, deleting and filling on the canvas workspace
  - socket connection, users share the same canvas (work in progress)
  - optimized fill algorithm (calculate color differences using euclidian distance to find borders)
